--->Dependency injection, or DI, is one of the fundamental concepts in Angular. DI is wired into the Angular framework and allows classes with Angular decorators, such as Components, Directives, Pipes, and Injectables, to configure dependencies that they need.
--->It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways. Using DI, we move the creation and binding of the dependent objects outside of the class that depends on them.

2.
--->Injectable() decorator is used to inject other services or objects into your service. The @Injectable decorator should be added to any service that uses dependency injection (DI).
--->You can configure injectors with providers at different levels of your app, by setting a metadata value in one of three places:
    -->In the @Injectable() decorator for the service itself.
    -->In the @NgModule() decorator for an NgModule.
    -->In the @Component() decorator for a component.
